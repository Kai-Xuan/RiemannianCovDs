The ETH-80 dataset is needed to be downloaded(https://github.com/Kai-Xuan/ETH-80/),  
and put 8 filefolders(visual image sets from 8 different categories) into filefolder '.\ETH-80\'.  
Please run 'read_ETH.m' to generate CSPD matrices. Then run 'run_ETH_NNMethods.m' and 'run_ETH_DisMethods.m' for image set classification.  


For Riemannian local difference vector on SPD manifold and Riemannian means on SPD manifold. please refer to:

For classification, we employ four NN classifiers and four discriminative classifiers in this source code(Version 2.0).  

Ker-SVM : Qilong Wang implemented a one-vs-all classifier by using LIBSVM package in the paper:

LogEKSR : This method was proposed in the paper:
